## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-06

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Multi-rate Simulink semantics fix (ADR-0015)**: All discrete blocks now match
  Simulink's `y(t in [n*T, (n+1)*T)) = u((n-1)*T)` semantics in the multi-rate
  case (`sample_time > dt_base`). The `1 dt_base` off-by-one limitation noted in
  v0.3.0's "Known limitations" is resolved.
  - Implementation: `Simulator.run()` fires updates at sample boundary START
    (`k % step_ratio == 0`) before `[A]` output, using a 2-pass approach.
  - All discrete blocks adopt **2-state augmentation**:
    - `UnitDelay` / `ZeroOrderHold`: `n_states` 1 → 2 (state[0]=output_curr,
      state[1]=output_next).
    - `DiscreteIntegrator`: `n_states` 1 → 2.
    - `DiscreteStateSpace` / `DiscreteTransferFunction`: `n_states` n → 2n.
  - `ZeroOrderHoldDirect` is unchanged (df=True direct reflection still works).
- **JSON schema bumped 0.2 → 0.3**: external `x0` representation in JSON is
  preserved (still scalar / shape-(n,)); internal expansion to 2-state is
  handled by Block `__init__`. Migration is automatic via the existing
  `migrate_to_current` chain.
- Single-rate (`sample_time = dt_base`) numerical results are unchanged for
  open-loop usage. Single-rate **feedback** loops through `UnitDelay` /
  `ZeroOrderHold` may produce different output sequences (period extends from
  2 to 4) due to the 2-state register semantics — this is consistent with
  Simulink's 2-state internal model and was implicit in v0.3.0's 1-state
  approximation.

### Added
- `tests/test_multirate_simulink.py`: 10 regression tests pinning the
  Simulink-compatible multi-rate semantics for all five discrete block types.
- Playwright E2E smoke tests for the Web GUI (`pyflw/web/frontend/tests/e2e/`).
  Covers root render, model list, model selection, and Run button +
  WebSocket completion. Run locally with
  `npm --prefix pyflw/web/frontend run e2e`.
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci-frontend.yml` gains an `e2e` job that installs
  pyflw with `[gui]` extras, caches Playwright browsers, and runs the
  smoke suite on every frontend PR.
- `ParameterPanel` component for inline editing of numeric block parameters
  (ADR-0012 §(3); §(10) "Phase 3 deferred" for this item is withdrawn).
  Click a node in the diagram to populate the right-hand panel; numeric
  fields become editable and the Save button persists via
  `PUT /api/v1/models/{id}`. Non-numeric params (lists, objects, strings)
  are surfaced as a read-only collapsible JSON view.
- `pyflw/web/frontend/tests/paramEdit.test.ts` (10 unit tests) and
  `tests/e2e/parameter-panel.spec.ts` (2 E2E tests) covering the new
  ParameterPanel behavior.

### Changed
- CI workflows are split: `ci.yml` (Python lint/type/test/docs) and
  `ci-frontend.yml` (Vite/Vitest/Playwright). Each uses `paths` filters
  so that pure-Python PRs no longer pay the npm install/build cost and
  vice versa.
- Web frontend layout extended to a 3-column grid (Models | Diagram |
  Parameters) to host the new ParameterPanel.

### Fixed
- `vitest.config.ts` now excludes `tests/e2e/**` so Vitest no longer
  mis-collects Playwright specs (which uses `@playwright/test`'s own
  `test.describe`).

### Documentation
- `.claude/docs/adr/0015-multirate-unitdelay-2-state-refactor.md` (Accepted).
- ADR-0014 marked as partially superseded by ADR-0015 (multi-rate parts only;
  single-rate Decision and `(t_k, u(t_k))` semantics retained).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-06

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Simulator loop semantics fix (ADR-0014)**: `update(t, x, u)` is now invoked
  with the current sample time `t_k` and the input sampled at `t_k`
  (`u(t_k)`), not the next sample time `t_new = (k+1)*dt_base`. This brings
  numerical results of all discrete blocks in line with standard discrete-time
  LTI semantics (`x[k+1] = f(x[k], u[k])`) and Simulink convention. As a
  consequence, **numerical results of `UnitDelay`, `ZeroOrderHold`,
  `DiscreteIntegrator`, `DiscreteStateSpace`, `DiscreteTransferFunction`
  change** when `sample_time = dt_base` (single-rate). Specifically:
  - `UnitDelay` now produces a genuine 1-sample delay `y[k+1] = u[k]` (was
    effectively 0-sample delay before).
  - `ZeroOrderHold` becomes behaviorally identical to `UnitDelay`
    (1-sample-delayed sample-and-hold). For Simulink-compatible immediate
    reflection (`y(t_k) = u(t_k)`), use the new `ZeroOrderHoldDirect` block.
  - `DiscreteIntegrator` now matches the standard forward Euler
    `x[k+1] = x[k] + T*g*u[k]` (the previous version had a 1-step index shift).
  - `DiscreteStateSpace` / `DiscreteTransferFunction` now match the standard
    discrete-time LTI form `x[k+1] = A x[k] + B u[k]`.
- Models created with v0.2.0 will produce different numerical outputs at
  sample boundaries when discrete blocks are involved. Continuous-only models
  (e.g. `examples/spring_mass_damper.py`) are unaffected.
- ADR-0005 §(4) is partially superseded by ADR-0014 §(1). ADR-0002 §(4) is
  updated to reflect the new loop. ADR-0010 §(5)(6) erratum: the prior claim
  that `ZeroOrderHold` was equivalent to `UnitDelay` was incorrect; with
  ADR-0014 it now becomes equivalent. The Phase 3 deferral of
  `ZeroOrderHoldDirect` is withdrawn.

### Added
- `pyflw.blocks.ZeroOrderHoldDirect`: true Simulink Zero-Order Hold
  (`direct_feedthrough=True`, `y(t_k) = u(t_k)` immediate reflection,
  hold between sample times). See ADR-0014 §(3).
- `tests/test_simulink_semantics.py`: regression tests pinning the
  Simulink-compatible semantics of all discrete blocks (`UnitDelay`,
  `ZeroOrderHold`, `ZeroOrderHoldDirect`, `DiscreteIntegrator`,
  `DiscreteStateSpace`, `DiscreteTransferFunction`).
- `.claude/docs/adr/0014-simulator-update-timing-fix.md` (Accepted, 2026-05-06).

### Deprecation notice
- `pyflw.blocks.ZeroOrderHold` is now behaviorally identical to `UnitDelay`
  and is scheduled for `DeprecationWarning` in Phase 3 and removal in Phase 4.
  Migrate to `UnitDelay` (for delayed sample-and-hold) or `ZeroOrderHoldDirect`
  (for immediate-reflection ZOH).

### Known limitations
- For multi-rate discrete blocks (`sample_time > dt_base`), the new loop
  samples `u` at `t = (n*step_ratio - 1) * dt_base` instead of the
  conceptual sample boundary `t = n*sample_time`, leading to a one-`dt_base`
  off-by-one shift compared to Simulink. A complete fix requires a 2-state
  refactor of `UnitDelay` / `ZeroOrderHold` and is deferred to a future ADR.
  For now, prefer `sample_time = dt_base` (single-rate) for full Simulink
  compatibility.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- JSON model persistence: `Simulator.save(path)` / `Simulator.load(path)` with
  schema_version 0.2 (ADR-0008, ADR-0009).
- Atomic Subsystem with internal mini-scheduler, including
  `pyflw.subsystems.{Inport, Outport, Subsystem}` (ADR-0009).
- 0.1 -> 0.2 schema migration registered as the first built-in migration.
- FastAPI Web GUI backend at `/api/v1/` with REST CRUD, simulation control, and
  WebSocket scope streaming (ADR-0011). New optional dependency group
  `pyflw[gui]`.
- React + TypeScript frontend skeleton under `pyflw/web/frontend/` (Vite,
  Zustand, TanStack Query, React Flow, Tailwind, ADR-0012). Read-only diagram
  view + Run/Stop + live scope canvas.
- `pyflw-server` console script entry point that launches FastAPI via uvicorn
  with sensible localhost defaults (ADR-0013).
- `pyflw.SimulationStillRunningError` and `pyflw.core.identifiers.validate_model_id`.
- `Simulator.on_step_callback` and `Simulator.request_stop()` /
  `Simulator.is_stopped` for cooperative cancellation from the server runtime.
- Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that builds the frontend,
  stages it under `pyflw/server/static/`, and publishes wheel+sdist to GitHub
  Releases on `v*` tag push.
- LICENSE (MIT, declared in `pyproject.toml` per PEP 639).
- `tests/test_version_consistency.py` enforcing `pyflw.__version__` ==
  `pyproject.toml [project].version`.

### Changed
- Block class registry uses an allowlist (default `pyflw.*`); third-party
  modules opt in via `register_block_module(prefix)` to mitigate hostile
  `.flw.json` files (ADR-0008).
- ADR-0010 formalizes signal model SM-A (each port carries one scalar);
  `Mux` / `Demux` and a `direct_feedthrough=True` ZeroOrderHold variant are
  deferred to Phase 3.
- ADR-0006 / 0007 / 0009 cross-reference cleanup; SPEC-0001 §未決事項 entries
  resolved by ADR-0005 / 0009 / 0010 / 0012.
- `pyproject.toml` build requirement raised to `setuptools>=71` for full PEP 639
  license expression support.

### Deferred to Phase 3
- True `ZeroOrderHoldDirect` (`direct_feedthrough=True`) — needs the ADR-0005
  step loop to be revisited.
- `MimoTransferFunction` (common-denominator and per-element variants).
- `Mux` / `Demux` blocks together with the SM-B vector-port signal model.
- Frontend drag-and-drop editing, block palette, parameter inline editor.
- Subsystem drill-down UI in the diagram canvas.
- PyPI publish automation in the release workflow (manual `twine upload` for
  now).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Phase 1 core engine: `Block` base class, `Simulator` (`scipy.solve_ivp`
  hybrid loop), 21 standard blocks across Sources / Sinks / Continuous /
  Discrete / Math / Logic / Routing including LTI (StateSpace,
  TransferFunction, Derivative, DiscreteStateSpace, DiscreteTransferFunction).
- `@block` decorator DSL with both function (Option A) and class (Option C)
  forms (ADR-0003).
- Multirate scheduler with integer-counter step ratios, inheritance for
  `sample_time = -1.0`, and warnings for non-integer ratios (ADR-0002, ADR-0005).
- Block ID convention `{type_name}_{counter}` with auto-numbering and
  `Simulator.rename` (ADR-0004).
- GitHub Actions CI matrix (ruff, mypy --strict, pytest 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13,
  Sphinx warnings-as-errors).
- Sphinx documentation initial release: quickstart, blocks reference,
  decorator guide, API reference.
