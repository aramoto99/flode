## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-06

Phase 3 #4 (Mux / Demux + SM-B run path integration). ADR-0018 Accepted.

### Added
- `pyflw.blocks.Mux(n)`: aggregates `n` scalar inputs into a single
  rank-1 vector of shape `(n,)`. `direct_feedthrough=True`, no state.
  `port_shapes_in = ((), ..., ())`, `port_shapes_out = ((n,),)`.
- `pyflw.blocks.Demux(n)`: splits a rank-1 vector input of shape
  `(n,)` into `n` scalar outputs. Inverse of `Mux`.
  `port_shapes_in = ((n,),)`, `port_shapes_out = ((), ..., ())`.
- `Inport` / `Outport` accept a `port_shape` keyword argument
  (default `()`) for SM-B subsystem boundaries. The internal
  `_external_value` is initialized as a float for SM-A or as an
  `np.ndarray` for SM-B. JSON serialization includes `port_shape` only
  when non-default.
- `Subsystem._build` now reconciles outer `port_shapes_in[i]` /
  `port_shapes_out[j]` with the inner `Inport(port_idx=i).port_shape` /
  `Outport(port_idx=j).port_shape`. Mismatches raise `BlockSpecError`.
- `Subsystem.to_dict` / `_from_dict` round-trip the SM-B
  `port_shapes_in` / `port_shapes_out` (when non-default), so an SM-B
  Subsystem can be saved and reloaded without losing its outer port
  declarations. Pure SM-A Subsystems remain byte-identical in JSON.
- `Simulator._check_subsystem_sm_b_unsupported`: when SM-B mode is
  active and any `Subsystem` declares a non-scalar port, `run()` raises
  `BlockSpecError` (Phase 4 will add `_step_inner_v`). This avoids the
  silent-truncation failure mode where SM-B input ndarrays would be
  coerced via `float(...)` inside the SM-A `_step_inner` path.
- `Simulator._step_vector` now validates that an `output_v` override
  returns exactly `n_outputs` items, catching mis-implemented
  vector-aware blocks at the source instead of as obscure downstream
  shape errors.
- `tests/blocks/test_mux_demux.py` / `test_mux_demux_edge_cases.py`
  (56 tests), `tests/core/test_sm_b_run.py` /
  `test_sm_b_run_edge_cases.py` (29 tests), and
  `tests/subsystems/test_subsystem_sm_b.py` (25 tests including SM-B
  Subsystem JSON round-trip and Phase-4 rejection regressions) cover
  the new SM-B paths end-to-end.

### Changed
- `Simulator.run()` dispatches to `_run_sm_a_loop()` (existing hot path,
  bit-for-bit compatible with v0.6.0) or to the new `_run_sm_b_loop()`
  for models that contain any SM-B port. The SM-B loop builds outputs
  via `_step_vector(...)` and integrates continuous states using a
  `f_continuous_vector` adapter that bridges SM-A `derivative()` blocks
  (e.g. `Integrator`) by collapsing the SM-B input tuple to a 1D
  ndarray. Pure SM-A models never enter the SM-B path.
- `Block.to_dict()` honours a new `_serialize_port_shapes` class flag.
  Mux / Demux / Inport / Outport set it to `False` so their
  `port_shapes_*` are derived from `n` / `port_shape` at load time and
  are never written to JSON twice.
- The framework-internal `Inport` / `Outport` blocks set
  `_skip_dual_api_check = True` so the ADR-0017 §(8) U3 dual-API guard
  does not flag their intentional `output` + `output_v` co-existence.
- `Scope` is asserted to be SM-A only at build time when SM-B mode is
  active (`Simulator._check_scope_inputs_are_scalar`). Connecting a
  vector signal directly to a `Scope` raises `BlockSpecError` with a
  hint to insert a `Demux` first.

### Migration
- Pure SM-A models: no action required, JSON is byte-identical.
- ADR-0017 schema 0.4: unchanged.
- The placeholder `BlockSpecError("SM-B vector ports detected, but the
  SM-B simulation runtime is not yet wired up")` from v0.6.0 is gone;
  SM-B models now run directly. Tests that asserted that error
  (`TestSmBRunNotImplemented`, `TestSmBRunErrorMessage`) have been
  renamed to `TestSmBRunEnabled` and verify successful completion.

### Verified
- 641 tests pass (existing 541 + 100 new SM-B tests including
  edge-case suites and code-reviewer regression coverage).
- `ruff check pyflw tests` and `mypy pyflw` clean.
- `examples/spring_mass_damper.py` numerical output unchanged
  (`Final x=0.2505, x_dot=0.0031`).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-06

Phase 3 #3 (signal model SM-B). ADR-0017 Accepted.

### Changed (BREAKING)
- `Block.__init__` accepts two new optional keyword arguments,
  `port_shapes_in` and `port_shapes_out`. They default to `None` (= all
  ports are SM-A scalars represented as rank-0 shape `()`), so all 33
  bundled blocks are unaffected.
- `Simulator` runs a build-time port-shape consistency check inside
  `_execution_order()`. When a `connect()` joins ports whose declared
  shapes disagree, a `BlockSpecError` is raised with a hint to use
  Mux/Demux (Phase 3 #4) for scalar/vector adaptation.
- JSON schema bumped 0.3 -> 0.4. The `port_shapes_in` / `port_shapes_out`
  fields are reserved as **optional**; for SM-A models the on-disk JSON
  is unchanged. Migration is handled automatically via the existing
  `migrate_to_current` chain (`schema_version` string update only).

### Added
- `Block.output_v(t, x, u)` SM-B vector-port API. The default
  implementation wraps `Block.output(...)` so SM-A blocks remain
  unchanged. SM-B-aware blocks (e.g. forthcoming Mux / Demux) override
  `output_v`.
- `Simulator._step_vector(...)` scaffolding that walks the topological
  order using tuple-of-ndarray inputs/outputs. Wired up at run-time in
  Phase 3 #4 once the first vector-aware blocks ship.
- `Simulator._is_sm_a_mode()` helper used by `run()` to fast-path
  scalar-only models. SM-B-only models currently raise a clear
  `BlockSpecError` ("SM-B vector ports detected, but the SM-B simulation
  runtime is not yet wired up"); this is intentional Phase 3 #3
  scaffolding and will be lifted by Phase 3 #4.
- `Subsystem.__init__` accepts `port_shapes_in` / `port_shapes_out` so
  composite blocks can declare vector boundaries; internal `Inport` /
  `Outport` reconciliation is part of Phase 3 #4.
- `tests/core/test_port_shapes.py`: 21 new tests covering port-shape
  normalization, SM-A compatibility, build-time mismatch errors,
  `output_v` wrapper behaviour, the SM-B run-time placeholder, and
  schema 0.3 -> 0.4 migration (including chained 0.2 -> 0.3 -> 0.4).
- `tests/core/test_port_shapes_edge_cases.py`: 96 additional edge-case
  tests covering boundary conditions, all 33 bundled blocks, Subsystem
  round-trip, rank-0 conversion fidelity, and SM-A/SM-B mode detection.

### Deferred to Phase 3 #4
- SM-B run-time integration (`run()` dispatch, scope record / Integrator
  derivative bridging through the vector pipeline).
- Concrete `Mux` / `Demux` blocks.
- Subsystem internal `Inport` / `Outport` port-shape reconciliation.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-06

Phase 3 opens. ADR-0016 (Phase 3 architecture overview) is now Accepted; it
sets the priorities, versioning plan (v0.5.0 -> v0.9.0), and the items
deferred to Phase 4 (RateTransition, triggered subsystems, SPEC-0001 #16-#21).

### Added
- `pyflw.blocks.MimoTransferFunction`: continuous-time MIMO LTI transfer
  function with shared denominator (ADR-0010 §(2), ADR-0016 Phase 3 #1).
  Implementation builds the controllable canonical form manually via
  `pyflw.blocks._lti_utils.build_companion_form_siso` to side-step the
  `scipy.signal.tf2ss` zero-numerator bug; the realization is the parallel
  composition of one SISO companion-form block per `(i, j)` entry, joined
  through a block-diagonal `A` (state size `p*q*n`). Phase 3 supports the
  **shared-denominator** form only; per-entry independent denominators are
  deferred to Phase 4+.

### Deprecated
- `pyflw.blocks.ZeroOrderHold` now emits a `DeprecationWarning` on
  construction (ADR-0014 §(4), ADR-0016 Phase 3 #2). It is functionally
  identical to `UnitDelay` since v0.3.0 (ADR-0014) and is scheduled for
  removal in Phase 4. Migrate to:
  - `UnitDelay` for 1-sample delayed sample-and-hold, or
  - `ZeroOrderHoldDirect` for Simulink-compatible immediate reflection
    (`y(t_k) = u(t_k)`).

### Documentation
- `.claude/docs/adr/0016-phase3-architecture-overview.md` (Accepted).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-06

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Multi-rate Simulink semantics fix (ADR-0015)**: All discrete blocks now match
  Simulink's `y(t in [n*T, (n+1)*T)) = u((n-1)*T)` semantics in the multi-rate
  case (`sample_time > dt_base`). The `1 dt_base` off-by-one limitation noted in
  v0.3.0's "Known limitations" is resolved.
  - Implementation: `Simulator.run()` fires updates at sample boundary START
    (`k % step_ratio == 0`) before `[A]` output, using a 2-pass approach.
  - All discrete blocks adopt **2-state augmentation**:
    - `UnitDelay` / `ZeroOrderHold`: `n_states` 1 → 2 (state[0]=output_curr,
      state[1]=output_next).
    - `DiscreteIntegrator`: `n_states` 1 → 2.
    - `DiscreteStateSpace` / `DiscreteTransferFunction`: `n_states` n → 2n.
  - `ZeroOrderHoldDirect` is unchanged (df=True direct reflection still works).
- **JSON schema bumped 0.2 → 0.3**: external `x0` representation in JSON is
  preserved (still scalar / shape-(n,)); internal expansion to 2-state is
  handled by Block `__init__`. Migration is automatic via the existing
  `migrate_to_current` chain.
- Single-rate (`sample_time = dt_base`) numerical results are unchanged for
  open-loop usage. Single-rate **feedback** loops through `UnitDelay` /
  `ZeroOrderHold` may produce different output sequences (period extends from
  2 to 4) due to the 2-state register semantics — this is consistent with
  Simulink's 2-state internal model and was implicit in v0.3.0's 1-state
  approximation.

### Added
- `tests/test_multirate_simulink.py`: 10 regression tests pinning the
  Simulink-compatible multi-rate semantics for all five discrete block types.
- Playwright E2E smoke tests for the Web GUI (`pyflw/web/frontend/tests/e2e/`).
  Covers root render, model list, model selection, and Run button +
  WebSocket completion. Run locally with
  `npm --prefix pyflw/web/frontend run e2e`.
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci-frontend.yml` gains an `e2e` job that installs
  pyflw with `[gui]` extras, caches Playwright browsers, and runs the
  smoke suite on every frontend PR.
- `ParameterPanel` component for inline editing of numeric block parameters
  (ADR-0012 §(3); §(10) "Phase 3 deferred" for this item is withdrawn).
  Click a node in the diagram to populate the right-hand panel; numeric
  fields become editable and the Save button persists via
  `PUT /api/v1/models/{id}`. Non-numeric params (lists, objects, strings)
  are surfaced as a read-only collapsible JSON view.
- `pyflw/web/frontend/tests/paramEdit.test.ts` (10 unit tests) and
  `tests/e2e/parameter-panel.spec.ts` (2 E2E tests) covering the new
  ParameterPanel behavior.

### Changed
- CI workflows are split: `ci.yml` (Python lint/type/test/docs) and
  `ci-frontend.yml` (Vite/Vitest/Playwright). Each uses `paths` filters
  so that pure-Python PRs no longer pay the npm install/build cost and
  vice versa.
- Web frontend layout extended to a 3-column grid (Models | Diagram |
  Parameters) to host the new ParameterPanel.

### Fixed
- `vitest.config.ts` now excludes `tests/e2e/**` so Vitest no longer
  mis-collects Playwright specs (which uses `@playwright/test`'s own
  `test.describe`).

### Documentation
- `.claude/docs/adr/0015-multirate-unitdelay-2-state-refactor.md` (Accepted).
- ADR-0014 marked as partially superseded by ADR-0015 (multi-rate parts only;
  single-rate Decision and `(t_k, u(t_k))` semantics retained).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-06

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Simulator loop semantics fix (ADR-0014)**: `update(t, x, u)` is now invoked
  with the current sample time `t_k` and the input sampled at `t_k`
  (`u(t_k)`), not the next sample time `t_new = (k+1)*dt_base`. This brings
  numerical results of all discrete blocks in line with standard discrete-time
  LTI semantics (`x[k+1] = f(x[k], u[k])`) and Simulink convention. As a
  consequence, **numerical results of `UnitDelay`, `ZeroOrderHold`,
  `DiscreteIntegrator`, `DiscreteStateSpace`, `DiscreteTransferFunction`
  change** when `sample_time = dt_base` (single-rate). Specifically:
  - `UnitDelay` now produces a genuine 1-sample delay `y[k+1] = u[k]` (was
    effectively 0-sample delay before).
  - `ZeroOrderHold` becomes behaviorally identical to `UnitDelay`
    (1-sample-delayed sample-and-hold). For Simulink-compatible immediate
    reflection (`y(t_k) = u(t_k)`), use the new `ZeroOrderHoldDirect` block.
  - `DiscreteIntegrator` now matches the standard forward Euler
    `x[k+1] = x[k] + T*g*u[k]` (the previous version had a 1-step index shift).
  - `DiscreteStateSpace` / `DiscreteTransferFunction` now match the standard
    discrete-time LTI form `x[k+1] = A x[k] + B u[k]`.
- Models created with v0.2.0 will produce different numerical outputs at
  sample boundaries when discrete blocks are involved. Continuous-only models
  (e.g. `examples/spring_mass_damper.py`) are unaffected.
- ADR-0005 §(4) is partially superseded by ADR-0014 §(1). ADR-0002 §(4) is
  updated to reflect the new loop. ADR-0010 §(5)(6) erratum: the prior claim
  that `ZeroOrderHold` was equivalent to `UnitDelay` was incorrect; with
  ADR-0014 it now becomes equivalent. The Phase 3 deferral of
  `ZeroOrderHoldDirect` is withdrawn.

### Added
- `pyflw.blocks.ZeroOrderHoldDirect`: true Simulink Zero-Order Hold
  (`direct_feedthrough=True`, `y(t_k) = u(t_k)` immediate reflection,
  hold between sample times). See ADR-0014 §(3).
- `tests/test_simulink_semantics.py`: regression tests pinning the
  Simulink-compatible semantics of all discrete blocks (`UnitDelay`,
  `ZeroOrderHold`, `ZeroOrderHoldDirect`, `DiscreteIntegrator`,
  `DiscreteStateSpace`, `DiscreteTransferFunction`).
- `.claude/docs/adr/0014-simulator-update-timing-fix.md` (Accepted, 2026-05-06).

### Deprecation notice
- `pyflw.blocks.ZeroOrderHold` is now behaviorally identical to `UnitDelay`
  and is scheduled for `DeprecationWarning` in Phase 3 and removal in Phase 4.
  Migrate to `UnitDelay` (for delayed sample-and-hold) or `ZeroOrderHoldDirect`
  (for immediate-reflection ZOH).

### Known limitations
- For multi-rate discrete blocks (`sample_time > dt_base`), the new loop
  samples `u` at `t = (n*step_ratio - 1) * dt_base` instead of the
  conceptual sample boundary `t = n*sample_time`, leading to a one-`dt_base`
  off-by-one shift compared to Simulink. A complete fix requires a 2-state
  refactor of `UnitDelay` / `ZeroOrderHold` and is deferred to a future ADR.
  For now, prefer `sample_time = dt_base` (single-rate) for full Simulink
  compatibility.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- JSON model persistence: `Simulator.save(path)` / `Simulator.load(path)` with
  schema_version 0.2 (ADR-0008, ADR-0009).
- Atomic Subsystem with internal mini-scheduler, including
  `pyflw.subsystems.{Inport, Outport, Subsystem}` (ADR-0009).
- 0.1 -> 0.2 schema migration registered as the first built-in migration.
- FastAPI Web GUI backend at `/api/v1/` with REST CRUD, simulation control, and
  WebSocket scope streaming (ADR-0011). New optional dependency group
  `pyflw[gui]`.
- React + TypeScript frontend skeleton under `pyflw/web/frontend/` (Vite,
  Zustand, TanStack Query, React Flow, Tailwind, ADR-0012). Read-only diagram
  view + Run/Stop + live scope canvas.
- `pyflw-server` console script entry point that launches FastAPI via uvicorn
  with sensible localhost defaults (ADR-0013).
- `pyflw.SimulationStillRunningError` and `pyflw.core.identifiers.validate_model_id`.
- `Simulator.on_step_callback` and `Simulator.request_stop()` /
  `Simulator.is_stopped` for cooperative cancellation from the server runtime.
- Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that builds the frontend,
  stages it under `pyflw/server/static/`, and publishes wheel+sdist to GitHub
  Releases on `v*` tag push.
- LICENSE (MIT, declared in `pyproject.toml` per PEP 639).
- `tests/test_version_consistency.py` enforcing `pyflw.__version__` ==
  `pyproject.toml [project].version`.

### Changed
- Block class registry uses an allowlist (default `pyflw.*`); third-party
  modules opt in via `register_block_module(prefix)` to mitigate hostile
  `.flw.json` files (ADR-0008).
- ADR-0010 formalizes signal model SM-A (each port carries one scalar);
  `Mux` / `Demux` and a `direct_feedthrough=True` ZeroOrderHold variant are
  deferred to Phase 3.
- ADR-0006 / 0007 / 0009 cross-reference cleanup; SPEC-0001 §未決事項 entries
  resolved by ADR-0005 / 0009 / 0010 / 0012.
- `pyproject.toml` build requirement raised to `setuptools>=71` for full PEP 639
  license expression support.

### Deferred to Phase 3
- True `ZeroOrderHoldDirect` (`direct_feedthrough=True`) — needs the ADR-0005
  step loop to be revisited.
- `MimoTransferFunction` (common-denominator and per-element variants).
- `Mux` / `Demux` blocks together with the SM-B vector-port signal model.
- Frontend drag-and-drop editing, block palette, parameter inline editor.
- Subsystem drill-down UI in the diagram canvas.
- PyPI publish automation in the release workflow (manual `twine upload` for
  now).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Phase 1 core engine: `Block` base class, `Simulator` (`scipy.solve_ivp`
  hybrid loop), 21 standard blocks across Sources / Sinks / Continuous /
  Discrete / Math / Logic / Routing including LTI (StateSpace,
  TransferFunction, Derivative, DiscreteStateSpace, DiscreteTransferFunction).
- `@block` decorator DSL with both function (Option A) and class (Option C)
  forms (ADR-0003).
- Multirate scheduler with integer-counter step ratios, inheritance for
  `sample_time = -1.0`, and warnings for non-integer ratios (ADR-0002, ADR-0005).
- Block ID convention `{type_name}_{counter}` with auto-numbering and
  `Simulator.rename` (ADR-0004).
- GitHub Actions CI matrix (ruff, mypy --strict, pytest 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13,
  Sphinx warnings-as-errors).
- Sphinx documentation initial release: quickstart, blocks reference,
  decorator guide, API reference.
